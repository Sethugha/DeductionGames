  "content": "\nOn glancing over my notes of the seventy odd cases in which I have\nduring the last eight years studied the methods of my friend Sherlock\nHolmes, I find many tragic, some comic, a large number merely strange,\nbut none commonplace; for, working as he did rather for the love of his\nart than for the acquirement of wealth, he refused to associate himself\nwith any investigation which did not tend towards the unusual, and even\nthe fantastic. Of all these varied cases, however, I cannot recall any\nwhich presented more singular features than that which was associated\nwith the well-known Surrey family of the Roylotts of Stoke Moran. The\nevents in question occurred in the early days of my association with\nHolmes, when we were sharing rooms as bachelors in Baker Street. It is\npossible that I might have placed them upon record before, but a\npromise of secrecy was made at the time, from which I have only been\nfreed during the last month by the untimely death of the lady to whom\nthe pledge was given. It is perhaps as well that the facts should now\ncome to light, for I have reasons to know that there are widespread\nrumours as to the death of Dr. Grimesby Roylott which tend to make the\nmatter even more terrible than the truth.\n\nIt was early in April in the year ’83 that I woke one morning to find\nSherlock Holmes standing, fully dressed, by the side of my bed. He was\na late riser, as a rule, and as the clock on the mantelpiece showed me\nthat it was only a quarter-past seven, I blinked up at him in some\nsurprise, and perhaps just a little resentment, for I was myself\nregular in my habits.\n\n'Very sorry to knock you up, Watson,' said he, 'but it’s the common lot\nthis morning. Mrs. Hudson has been knocked up, she retorted upon me,\nand I on you.'\n\n'What is it, then—a fire?'\n\n'No; a client. It seems that a young lady has arrived in a considerable\nstate of excitement, who insists upon seeing me. She is waiting now in\nthe sitting-room. Now, when young ladies wander about the metropolis at\nthis hour of the morning, and knock sleepy people up out of their beds,\nI presume that it is something very pressing which they have to\ncommunicate. Should it prove to be an interesting case, you would, I am\nsure, wish to follow it from the outset. I thought, at any rate, that I\nshould call you and give you the chance.'\n\n'My dear fellow, I would not miss it for anything.'\n\nI had no keener pleasure than in following Holmes in his professional\ninvestigations, and in admiring the rapid deductions, as swift as\nintuitions, and yet always founded on a logical basis with which he\nunravelled the problems which were submitted to him. I rapidly threw on\nmy clothes and was ready in a few minutes to accompany my friend down\nto the sitting-room. A lady dressed in black and heavily veiled, who\nhad been sitting in the window, rose as we entered.\n\n'Good-morning, madam,' said Holmes cheerily. 'My name is Sherlock\nHolmes. This is my intimate friend and associate, Dr. Watson, before\nwhom you can speak as freely as before myself. Ha! I am glad to see\nthat Mrs. Hudson has had the good sense to light the fire. Pray draw up\nto it, and I shall order you a cup of hot coffee, for I observe that\nyou are shivering.'\n\n'It is not cold which makes me shiver,' said the woman in a low voice,\nchanging her seat as requested.\n\n'What, then?'\n\n'It is fear, Mr. Holmes. It is terror.' She raised her veil as she\nspoke, and we could see that she was indeed in a pitiable state of\nagitation, her face all drawn and grey, with restless frightened eyes,\nlike those of some hunted animal. Her features and figure were those of\na woman of thirty, but her hair was shot with premature grey, and her\nexpression was weary and haggard. Sherlock Holmes ran her over with one\nof his quick, all-comprehensive glances.\n\n'You must not fear,' said he soothingly, bending forward and patting\nher forearm. 'We shall soon set matters right, I have no doubt. You\nhave come in by train this morning, I see.'\n\n'You know me, then?'\n\n'No, but I observe the second half of a return ticket in the palm of\nyour left glove. You must have started early, and yet you had a good\ndrive in a dog-cart, along heavy roads, before you reached the\nstation.'\n\nThe lady gave a violent start and stared in bewilderment at my\ncompanion.\n\n'There is no mystery, my dear madam,' said he, smiling. 'The left arm\nof your jacket is spattered with mud in no less than seven places. The\nmarks are perfectly fresh. There is no vehicle save a dog-cart which\nthrows up mud in that way, and then only when you sit on the left-hand\nside of the driver.'\n\n'Whatever your reasons may be, you are perfectly correct,' said she. 'I\nstarted from home before six, reached Leatherhead at twenty past, and\ncame in by the first train to Waterloo. Sir, I can stand this strain no\nlonger; I shall go mad if it continues. I have no one to turn to—none,\nsave only one, who cares for me, and he, poor fellow, can be of little\naid. I have heard of you, Mr. Holmes; I have heard of you from Mrs.\nFarintosh, whom you helped in the hour of her sore need. It was from\nher that I had your address. Oh, sir, do you not think that you could\nhelp me, too, and at least throw a little light through the dense\ndarkness which surrounds me? At present it is out of my power to reward\nyou for your services, but in a month or six weeks I shall be married,\nwith the control of my own income, and then at least you shall not find\nme ungrateful.'\n\nHolmes turned to his desk and, unlocking it, drew out a small\ncase-book, which he consulted.\n\n'Farintosh,' said he. 'Ah yes, I recall the case; it was concerned with\nan opal tiara. I think it was before your time, Watson. I can only say,\nmadam, that I shall be happy to devote the same care to your case as I\ndid to that of your friend. As to reward, my profession is its own\nreward; but you are at liberty to defray whatever expenses I may be put\nto, at the time which suits you best. And now I beg that you will lay\nbefore us everything that may help us in forming an opinion upon the\nmatter.'\n\n'Alas!' replied our visitor, 'the very horror of my situation lies in\nthe fact that my fears are so vague, and my suspicions depend so\nentirely upon small points, which might seem trivial to another, that\neven he to whom of all others I have a right to look for help and\nadvice looks upon all that I tell him about it as the fancies of a\nnervous woman. He does not say so, but I can read it from his soothing\nanswers and averted eyes. But I have heard, Mr. Holmes, that you can\nsee deeply into the manifold wickedness of the human heart. You may\nadvise me how to walk amid the dangers which encompass me.'\n\n'I am all attention, madam.'\n\n'My name is Helen Stoner, and I am living with my stepfather, who is\nthe last survivor of one of the oldest Saxon families in England, the\nRoylotts of Stoke Moran, on the western border of Surrey.'\n\nHolmes nodded his head. 'The name is familiar to me,' said he.\n\n'The family was at one time among the richest in England, and the\nestates extended over the borders into Berkshire in the north, and\nHampshire in the west. In the last century, however, four successive\nheirs were of a dissolute and wasteful disposition, and the family ruin\nwas eventually completed by a gambler in the days of the Regency.\nNothing was left save a few acres of ground, and the\ntwo-hundred-year-old house, which is itself crushed under a heavy\nmortgage. The last squire dragged out his existence there, living the\nhorrible life of an aristocratic pauper; but his only son, my\nstepfather, seeing that he must adapt himself to the new conditions,\nobtained an advance from a relative, which enabled him to take a\nmedical degree and went out to Calcutta, where, by his professional\nskill and his force of character, he established a large practice. In a\nfit of anger, however, caused by some robberies which had been\nperpetrated in the house, he beat his native butler to death and\nnarrowly escaped a capital sentence. As it was, he suffered a long term\nof imprisonment and afterwards returned to England a morose and\ndisappointed man.\n\n'When Dr. Roylott was in India he married my mother, Mrs. Stoner, the\nyoung widow of Major-General Stoner, of the Bengal Artillery. My sister\nJulia and I were twins, and we were only two years old at the time of\nmy mother’s re-marriage. She had a considerable sum of money—not less\nthan £ 1000 a year—and this she bequeathed to Dr. Roylott entirely\nwhile we resided with him, with a provision that a certain annual sum\nshould be allowed to each of us in the event of our marriage. Shortly\nafter our return to England my mother died—she was killed eight years\nago in a railway accident near Crewe. Dr. Roylott then abandoned his\nattempts to establish himself in practice in London and took us to live\nwith him in the old ancestral house at Stoke Moran. The money which my\nmother had left was enough for all our wants, and there seemed to be no\nobstacle to our happiness.\n\n'But a terrible change came over our stepfather about this time.\nInstead of making friends and exchanging visits with our neighbours,\nwho had at first been overjoyed to see a Roylott of Stoke Moran back in\nthe old family seat, he shut himself up in his house and seldom came\nout save to indulge in ferocious quarrels with whoever might cross his\npath. Violence of temper approaching to mania has been hereditary in\nthe men of the family, and in my stepfather’s case it had, I believe,\nbeen intensified by his long residence in the tropics. A series of\ndisgraceful brawls took place, two of which ended in the police-court,\nuntil at last he became the terror of the village, and the folks would\nfly at his approach, for he is a man of immense strength, and\nabsolutely uncontrollable in his anger.\n\n'Last week he hurled the local blacksmith over a parapet into a stream,\nand it was only by paying over all the money which I could gather\ntogether that I was able to avert another public exposure. He had no\nfriends at all save the wandering gipsies, and he would give these\nvagabonds leave to encamp upon the few acres of bramble-covered land\nwhich represent the family estate, and would accept in return the\nhospitality of their tents, wandering away with them sometimes for\nweeks on end. He has a passion also for Indian animals, which are sent\nover to him by a correspondent, and he has at this moment a cheetah and\na baboon, which wander freely over his grounds and are feared by the\nvillagers almost as much as their master.\n\n'You can imagine from what I say that my poor sister Julia and I had no\ngreat pleasure in our lives. No servant would stay with us, and for a\nlong time we did all the work of the house. She was but thirty at the\ntime of her death, and yet her hair had already begun to whiten, even\nas mine has.'\n\n'Your sister is dead, then?'\n\n'She died just two years ago, and it is of her death that I wish to\nspeak to you. You can understand that, living the life which I have\ndescribed, we were little likely to see anyone of our own age and\nposition. We had, however, an aunt, my mother’s maiden sister, Miss\nHonoria Westphail, who lives near Harrow, and we were occasionally\nallowed to pay short visits at this lady’s house. Julia went there at\nChristmas two years ago, and met there a half-pay major of marines, to\nwhom she became engaged. My stepfather learned of the engagement when\nmy sister returned and offered no objection to the marriage; but within\na fortnight of the day which had been fixed for the wedding, the\nterrible event occurred which has deprived me of my only companion.'\n\nSherlock Holmes had been leaning back in his chair with his eyes closed\nand his head sunk in a cushion, but he half opened his lids now and\nglanced across at his visitor.\n\n'Pray be precise as to details,' said he.\n\n'It is easy for me to be so, for every event of that dreadful time is\nseared into my memory. The manor-house is, as I have already said, very\nold, and only one wing is now inhabited. The bedrooms in this wing are\non the ground floor, the sitting-rooms being in the central block of\nthe buildings. Of these bedrooms the first is Dr. Roylott’s, the second\nmy sister’s, and the third my own. There is no communication between\nthem, but they all open out into the same corridor. Do I make myself\nplain?'\n\n'Perfectly so.'\n\n'The windows of the three rooms open out upon the lawn. That fatal\nnight Dr. Roylott had gone to his room early, though we knew that he\nhad not retired to rest, for my sister was troubled by the smell of the\nstrong Indian cigars which it was his custom to smoke. She left her\nroom, therefore, and came into mine, where she sat for some time,\nchatting about her approaching wedding. At eleven o’clock she rose to\nleave me, but she paused at the door and looked back.\n\n'‘Tell me, Helen,’ said she, ‘have you ever heard anyone whistle in the\ndead of the night?’\n\n'‘Never,’ said I.\n\n'‘I suppose that you could not possibly whistle, yourself, in your\nsleep?’\n\n'‘Certainly not. But why?’\n\n'‘Because during the last few nights I have always, about three in the\nmorning, heard a low, clear whistle. I am a light sleeper, and it has\nawakened me. I cannot tell where it came from—perhaps from the next\nroom, perhaps from the lawn. I thought that I would just ask you\nwhether you had heard it.’\n\n'‘No, I have not. It must be those wretched gipsies in the plantation.’\n\n'‘Very likely. And yet if it were on the lawn, I wonder that you did\nnot hear it also.’\n\n'‘Ah, but I sleep more heavily than you.’\n\n'‘Well, it is of no great consequence, at any rate.’ She smiled back at\nme, closed my door, and a few moments later I heard her key turn in the\nlock.'\n\n'Indeed,' said Holmes. 'Was it your custom always to lock yourselves in\nat night?'\n\n'Always.'\n\n'And why?'\n\n'I think that I mentioned to you that the Doctor kept a cheetah and a\nbaboon. We had no feeling of security unless our doors were locked.'\n\n'Quite so. Pray proceed with your statement.'\n\n'I could not sleep that night. A vague feeling of impending misfortune\nimpressed me. My sister and I, you will recollect, were twins, and you\nknow how subtle are the links which bind two souls which are so closely\nallied. It was a wild night. The wind was howling outside, and the rain\nwas beating and splashing against the windows. Suddenly, amid all the\nhubbub of the gale, there burst forth the wild scream of a terrified\nwoman. I knew that it was my sister’s voice. I sprang from my bed,\nwrapped a shawl round me, and rushed into the corridor. As I opened my\ndoor I seemed to hear a low whistle, such as my sister described, and a\nfew moments later a clanging sound, as if a mass of metal had fallen.\nAs I ran down the passage, my sister’s door was unlocked, and revolved\nslowly upon its hinges. I stared at it horror-stricken, not knowing\nwhat was about to issue from it. By the light of the corridor-lamp I\nsaw my sister appear at the opening, her face blanched with terror, her\nhands groping for help, her whole figure swaying to and fro like that\nof a drunkard. I ran to her and threw my arms round her, but at that\nmoment her knees seemed to give way and she fell to the ground. She\nwrithed as one who is in terrible pain, and her limbs were dreadfully\nconvulsed. At first I thought that she had not recognised me, but as I\nbent over her she suddenly shrieked out in a voice which I shall never\nforget, ‘Oh, my God! Helen! It was the band! The speckled band!’ There\nwas something else which she would fain have said, and she stabbed with\nher finger into the air in the direction of the Doctor’s room, but a\nfresh convulsion seized her and choked her words. I rushed out, calling\nloudly for my stepfather, and I met him hastening from his room in his\ndressing-gown. When he reached my sister’s side she was unconscious,\nand though he poured brandy down her throat and sent for medical aid\nfrom the village, all efforts were in vain, for she slowly sank and\ndied without having recovered her consciousness. Such was the dreadful\nend of my beloved sister.'\n\n'One moment,' said Holmes, 'are you sure about this whistle and\nmetallic sound? Could you swear to it?'\n\n'That was what the county coroner asked me at the inquiry. It is my\nstrong impression that I heard it, and yet, among the crash of the gale\nand the creaking of an old house, I may possibly have been deceived.'\n\n'Was your sister dressed?'\n\n'No, she was in her night-dress. In her right hand was found the\ncharred stump of a match, and in her left a match-box.'\n\n'Showing that she had struck a light and looked about her when the\nalarm took place. That is important. And what conclusions did the\ncoroner come to?'\n\n'He investigated the case with great care, for Dr. Roylott’s conduct\nhad long been notorious in the county, but he was unable to find any\nsatisfactory cause of death. My evidence showed that the door had been\nfastened upon the inner side, and the windows were blocked by\nold-fashioned shutters with broad iron bars, which were secured every\nnight. The walls were carefully sounded, and were shown to be quite\nsolid all round, and the flooring was also thoroughly examined, with\nthe same result. The chimney is wide, but is barred up by four large\nstaples. It is certain, therefore, that my sister was quite alone when\nshe met her end. Besides, there were no marks of any violence upon\nher.'\n\n'How about poison?'\n\n'The doctors examined her for it, but without success.'\n\n'What do you think that this unfortunate lady died of, then?'\n\n'It is my belief that she died of pure fear and nervous shock, though\nwhat it was that frightened her I cannot imagine.'\n\n'Were there gipsies in the plantation at the time?'\n\n'Yes, there are nearly always some there.'\n\n'Ah, and what did you gather from this allusion to a band—a speckled\nband?'\n\n'Sometimes I have thought that it was merely the wild talk of delirium,\nsometimes that it may have referred to some band of people, perhaps to\nthese very gipsies in the plantation. I do not know whether the spotted\nhandkerchiefs which so many of them wear over their heads might have\nsuggested the strange adjective which she used.'\n\nHolmes shook his head like a man who is far from being satisfied.\n\n'These are very deep waters,' said he; 'pray go on with your\nnarrative.'\n\n'Two years have passed since then, and my life has been until lately\nlonelier than ever. A month ago, however, a dear friend, whom I have\nknown for many years, has done me the honour to ask my hand in\nmarriage. His name is Armitage—Percy Armitage—the second son of Mr.\nArmitage, of Crane Water, near Reading. My stepfather has offered no\nopposition to the match, and we are to be married in the course of the\nspring. Two days ago some repairs were started in the west wing of the\nbuilding, and my bedroom wall has been pierced, so that I have had to\nmove into the chamber in which my sister died, and to sleep in the very\nbed in which she slept. Imagine, then, my thrill of terror when last\nnight, as I lay awake, thinking over her terrible fate, I suddenly\nheard in the silence of the night the low whistle which had been the\nherald of her own death. I sprang up and lit the lamp, but nothing was\nto be seen in the room. I was too shaken to go to bed again, however,\nso I dressed, and as soon as it was daylight I slipped down, got a\ndog-cart at the Crown Inn, which is opposite, and drove to Leatherhead,\nfrom whence I have come on this morning with the one object of seeing\nyou and asking your advice.'\n\n'You have done wisely,' said my friend. 'But have you told me all?'\n\n'Yes, all.'\n\n'Miss Roylott, you have not. You are screening your stepfather.'\n\n'Why, what do you mean?'\n\nFor answer Holmes pushed back the frill of black lace which fringed the\nhand that lay upon our visitor’s knee. Five little livid spots, the\nmarks of four fingers and a thumb, were printed upon the white wrist.\n\n'You have been cruelly used,' said Holmes.\n\nThe lady coloured deeply and covered over her injured wrist. 'He is a\nhard man,' she said, 'and perhaps he hardly knows his own strength.'\n\nThere was a long silence, during which Holmes leaned his chin upon his\nhands and stared into the crackling fire.\n\n'This is a very deep business,' he said at last. 'There are a thousand\ndetails which I should desire to know before I decide upon our course\nof action. Yet we have not a moment to lose. If we were to come to\nStoke Moran to-day, would it be possible for us to see over these rooms\nwithout the knowledge of your stepfather?'\n\n'As it happens, he spoke of coming into town to-day upon some most\nimportant business. It is probable that he will be away all day, and\nthat there would be nothing to disturb you. We have a housekeeper now,\nbut she is old and foolish, and I could easily get her out of the way.'\n\n'Excellent. You are not averse to this trip, Watson?'\n\n'By no means.'\n\n'Then we shall both come. What are you going to do yourself?'\n\n'I have one or two things which I would wish to do now that I am in\ntown. But I shall return by the twelve o’clock train, so as to be there\nin time for your coming.'\n\n'And you may expect us early in the afternoon. I have myself some small\nbusiness matters to attend to. Will you not wait and breakfast?'\n\n'No, I must go. My heart is lightened already since I have confided my\ntrouble to you. I shall look forward to seeing you again this\nafternoon.' She dropped her thick black veil over her face and glided\nfrom the room.\n\n'And what do you think of it all, Watson?' asked Sherlock Holmes,\nleaning back in his chair.\n\n'It seems to me to be a most dark and sinister business.'\n\n'Dark enough and sinister enough.'\n\n'Yet if the lady is correct in saying that the flooring and walls are\nsound, and that the door, window, and chimney are impassable, then her\nsister must have been undoubtedly alone when she met her mysterious\nend.'\n\n'What becomes, then, of these nocturnal whistles, and what of the very\npeculiar words of the dying woman?'\n\n'I cannot think.'\n\n'When you combine the ideas of whistles at night, the presence of a\nband of gipsies who are on intimate terms with this old doctor, the\nfact that we have every reason to believe that the doctor has an\ninterest in preventing his stepdaughter’s marriage, the dying allusion\nto a band, and, finally, the fact that Miss Helen Stoner heard a\nmetallic clang, which might have been caused by one of those metal bars\nthat secured the shutters falling back into its place, I think that\nthere is good ground to think that the mystery may be cleared along\nthose lines.'\n\n'But what, then, did the gipsies do?'\n\n'I cannot imagine.'\n\n'I see many objections to any such theory.'\n\n'And so do I. It is precisely for that reason that we are going to\nStoke Moran this day. I want to see whether the objections are fatal,\nor if they may be explained away. But what in the name of the devil!'\n\nThe ejaculation had been drawn from my companion by the fact that our\ndoor had been suddenly dashed open, and that a huge man had framed\nhimself in the aperture. His costume was a peculiar mixture of the\nprofessional and of the agricultural, having a black top-hat, a long\nfrock-coat, and a pair of high gaiters, with a hunting-crop swinging in\nhis hand. So tall was he that his hat actually brushed the cross bar of\nthe doorway, and his breadth seemed to span it across from side to\nside. A large face, seared with a thousand wrinkles, burned yellow with\nthe sun, and marked with every evil passion, was turned from one to the\nother of us, while his deep-set, bile-shot eyes, and his high, thin,\nfleshless nose, gave him somewhat the resemblance to a fierce old bird\nof prey.\n\n'Which of you is Holmes?' asked this apparition.\n\n'My name, sir; but you have the advantage of me,' said my companion\nquietly.\n\n'I am Dr. Grimesby Roylott, of Stoke Moran.'\n\n'Indeed, Doctor,' said Holmes blandly. 'Pray take a seat.'\n\n'I will do nothing of the kind. My stepdaughter has been here. I have\ntraced her. What has she been saying to you?'\n\n'It is a little cold for the time of the year,' said Holmes.\n\n'What has she been saying to you?' screamed the old man furiously.\n\n'But I have heard that the crocuses promise well,' continued my\ncompanion imperturbably.\n\n'Ha! You put me off, do you?' said our new visitor, taking a step\nforward and shaking his hunting-crop. 'I know you, you scoundrel! I\nhave heard of you before. You are Holmes, the meddler.'\n\nMy friend smiled.\n\n'Holmes, the busybody!'\n\nHis smile broadened.\n\n'Holmes, the Scotland Yard Jack-in-office!'\n\nHolmes chuckled heartily. 'Your conversation is most entertaining,'\nsaid he. 'When you go out close the door, for there is a decided\ndraught.'\n\n'I will go when I have had my say. Don’t you dare to meddle with my\naffairs. I know that Miss Stoner has been here. I traced her! I am a\ndangerous man to fall foul of! See here.' He stepped swiftly forward,\nseized the poker, and bent it into a curve with his huge brown hands.\n\n'See that you keep yourself out of my grip,' he snarled, and hurling\nthe twisted poker into the fireplace he strode out of the room.\n\n'He seems a very amiable person,' said Holmes, laughing. 'I am not\nquite so bulky, but if he had remained I might have shown him that my\ngrip was not much more feeble than his own.' As he spoke he picked up\nthe steel poker and, with a sudden effort, straightened it out again.\n\n'Fancy his having the insolence to confound me with the official\ndetective force! This incident gives zest to our investigation,\nhowever, and I only trust that our little friend will not suffer from\nher imprudence in allowing this brute to trace her. And now, Watson, we\nshall order breakfast, and afterwards I shall walk down to Doctors’\nCommons, where I hope to get some data which may help us in this\nmatter.'\n\nIt was nearly one o’clock when Sherlock Holmes returned from his\nexcursion. He held in his hand a sheet of blue paper, scrawled over\nwith notes and figures.\n\n'I have seen the will of the deceased wife,' said he. 'To determine its\nexact meaning I have been obliged to work out the present prices of the\ninvestments with which it is concerned. The total income, which at the\ntime of the wife’s death was little short of £ 1,100, is now, through\nthe fall in agricultural prices, not more than £ 750. Each daughter can\nclaim an income of £ 250, in case of marriage. It is evident,\ntherefore, that if both girls had married, this beauty would have had a\nmere pittance, while even one of them would cripple him to a very\nserious extent. My morning’s work has not been wasted, since it has\nproved that he has the very strongest motives for standing in the way\nof anything of the sort. And now, Watson, this is too serious for\ndawdling, especially as the old man is aware that we are interesting\nourselves in his affairs; so if you are ready, we shall call a cab and\ndrive to Waterloo. I should be very much obliged if you would slip your\nrevolver into your pocket. An Eley’s No. 2 is an excellent argument\nwith gentlemen who can twist steel pokers into knots. That and a\ntooth-brush are, I think, all that we need.'\n\nAt Waterloo we were fortunate in catching a train for Leatherhead,\nwhere we hired a trap at the station inn and drove for four or five\nmiles through the lovely Surrey lanes. It was a perfect day, with a\nbright sun and a few fleecy clouds in the heavens. The trees and\nwayside hedges were just throwing out their first green shoots, and the\nair was full of the pleasant smell of the moist earth. To me at least\nthere was a strange contrast between the sweet promise of the spring\nand this sinister quest upon which we were engaged. My companion sat in\nthe front of the trap, his arms folded, his hat pulled down over his\neyes, and his chin sunk upon his breast, buried in the deepest thought.\nSuddenly, however, he started, tapped me on the shoulder, and pointed\nover the meadows.\n\n'Look there!' said he.\n\nA heavily timbered park stretched up in a gentle slope, thickening into\na grove at the highest point. From amid the branches there jutted out\nthe grey gables and high roof-tree of a very old mansion.\n\n'Stoke Moran?' said he.\n\n'Yes, sir, that be the house of Dr. Grimesby Roylott,' remarked the\ndriver.\n\n'There is some building going on there,' said Holmes; 'that is where we\nare going.'\n\n'There’s the village,' said the driver, pointing to a cluster of roofs\nsome distance to the left; 'but if you want to get to the house, you’ll\nfind it shorter to get over this stile, and so by the footpath over the\nfields. There it is, where the lady is walking.'\n\n'And the lady, I fancy, is Miss Stoner,' observed Holmes, shading his\neyes. 'Yes, I think we had better do as you suggest.'\n\nWe got off, paid our fare, and the trap rattled back on its way to\nLeatherhead.\n\n'I thought it as well,' said Holmes as we climbed the stile, 'that this\nfellow should think we had come here as architects, or on some definite\nbusiness. It may stop his gossip. Good-afternoon, Miss Stoner. You see\nthat we have been as good as our word.'\n\nOur client of the morning had hurried forward to meet us with a face\nwhich spoke her joy. 'I have been waiting so eagerly for you,' she\ncried, shaking hands with us warmly. 'All has turned out splendidly.\nDr. Roylott has gone to town, and it is unlikely that he will be back\nbefore evening.'\n\n'We have had the pleasure of making the Doctor’s acquaintance,' said\nHolmes, and in a few words he sketched out what had occurred. Miss\nStoner turned white to the lips as she listened.\n\n'Good heavens!' she cried, 'he has followed me, then.'\n\n'So it appears.'\n\n'He is so cunning that I never know when I am safe from him. What will\nhe say when he returns?'\n\n'He must guard himself, for he may find that there is someone more\ncunning than himself upon his track. You must lock yourself up from him\nto-night. If he is violent, we shall take you away to your aunt’s at\nHarrow. Now, we must make the best use of our time, so kindly take us\nat once to the rooms which we are to examine.'\n\nThe building was of grey, lichen-blotched stone, with a high central\nportion and two curving wings, like the claws of a crab, thrown out on\neach side. In one of these wings the windows were broken and blocked\nwith wooden boards, while the roof was partly caved in, a picture of\nruin. The central portion was in little better repair, but the\nright-hand block was comparatively modern, and the blinds in the\nwindows, with the blue smoke curling up from the chimneys, showed that\nthis was where the family resided. Some scaffolding had been erected\nagainst the end wall, and the stone-work had been broken into, but\nthere were no signs of any workmen at the moment of our visit. Holmes\nwalked slowly up and down the ill-trimmed lawn and examined with deep\nattention the outsides of the windows.\n\n'This, I take it, belongs to the room in which you used to sleep, the\ncentre one to your sister’s, and the one next to the main building to\nDr. Roylott’s chamber?'\n\n'Exactly so. But I am now sleeping in the middle one.'\n\n'Pending the alterations, as I understand. By the way, there does not\nseem to be any very pressing need for repairs at that end wall.'\n\n'There were none. I believe that it was an excuse to move me from my\nroom.'\n\n'Ah! that is suggestive. Now, on the other side of this narrow wing\nruns the corridor from which these three rooms open. There are windows\nin it, of course?'\n\n'Yes, but very small ones. Too narrow for anyone to pass through.'\n\n'As you both locked your doors at night, your rooms were unapproachable\nfrom that side. Now, would you have the kindness to go into your room\nand bar your shutters?'\n\nMiss Stoner did so, and Holmes, after a careful examination through the\nopen window, endeavoured in every way to force the shutter open, but\nwithout success. There was no slit through which a knife could be\npassed to raise the bar. Then with his lens he tested the hinges, but\nthey were of solid iron, built firmly into the massive masonry. 'Hum!'\nsaid he, scratching his chin in some perplexity, 'my theory certainly\npresents some difficulties. No one could pass these shutters if they\nwere bolted. Well, we shall see if the inside throws any light upon the\nmatter.'\n\nA small side door led into the whitewashed corridor from which the\nthree bedrooms opened. Holmes refused to examine the third chamber, so\nwe passed at once to the second, that in which Miss Stoner was now\nsleeping, and in which her sister had met with her fate. It was a\nhomely little room, with a low ceiling and a gaping fireplace, after\nthe fashion of old country-houses. A brown chest of drawers stood in\none corner, a narrow white-counterpaned bed in another, and a\ndressing-table on the left-hand side of the window. These articles,\nwith two small wicker-work chairs, made up all the furniture in the\nroom save for a square of Wilton carpet in the centre. The boards round\nand the panelling of the walls were of brown, worm-eaten oak, so old\nand discoloured that it may have dated from the original building of\nthe house. Holmes drew one of the chairs into a corner and sat silent,\nwhile his eyes travelled round and round and up and down, taking in\nevery detail of the apartment.\n\n'Where does that bell communicate with?' he asked at last pointing to a\nthick bell-rope which hung down beside the bed, the tassel actually\nlying upon the pillow.\n\n'It goes to the housekeeper’s room.'\n\n'It looks newer than the other things?'\n\n'Yes, it was only put there a couple of years ago.'\n\n'Your sister asked for it, I suppose?'\n\n'No, I never heard of her using it. We used always to get what we\nwanted for ourselves.'\n\n'Indeed, it seemed unnecessary to put so nice a bell-pull there. You\nwill excuse me for a few minutes while I satisfy myself as to this\nfloor.' He threw himself down upon his face with his lens in his hand\nand crawled swiftly backward and forward, examining minutely the cracks\nbetween the boards. Then he did the same with the wood-work with which\nthe chamber was panelled. Finally he walked over to the bed and spent\nsome time in staring at it and in running his eye up and down the wall.\nFinally he took the bell-rope in his hand and gave it a brisk tug.\n\n'Why, it’s a dummy,' said he.\n\n'Won’t it ring?'\n\n'No, it is not even attached to a wire. This is very interesting. You\ncan see now that it is fastened to a hook just above where the little\nopening for the ventilator is.'\n\n'How very absurd! I never noticed that before.'\n\n'Very strange!' muttered Holmes, pulling at the rope. 'There are one or\ntwo very singular points about this room. For example, what a fool a\nbuilder must be to open a ventilator into another room, when, with the\nsame trouble, he might have communicated with the outside air!'\n\n'That is also quite modern,' said the lady.\n\n'Done about the same time as the bell-rope?' remarked Holmes.\n\n'Yes, there were several little changes carried out about that time.'\n\n'They seem to have been of a most interesting character—dummy\nbell-ropes, and ventilators which do not ventilate. With your\npermission, Miss Stoner, we shall now carry our researches into the\ninner apartment.'\n\nDr. Grimesby Roylott’s chamber was larger than that of his\nstep-daughter, but was as plainly furnished. A camp-bed, a small wooden\nshelf full of books, mostly of a technical character, an armchair\nbeside the bed, a plain wooden chair against the wall, a round table,\nand a large iron safe were the principal things which met the eye.\nHolmes walked slowly round and examined each and all of them with the\nkeenest interest.\n\n'What’s in here?' he asked, tapping the safe.\n\n'My stepfather’s business papers.'\n\n'Oh! you have seen inside, then?'\n\n'Only once, some years ago. I remember that it was full of papers.'\n\n'There isn’t a cat in it, for example?'\n\n'No. What a strange idea!'\n\n'Well, look at this!' He took up a small saucer of milk which stood on\nthe top of it.\n\n'No; we don’t keep a cat. But there is a cheetah and a baboon.'\n\n'Ah, yes, of course! Well, a cheetah is just a big cat, and yet a\nsaucer of milk does not go very far in satisfying its wants, I daresay.\nThere is one point which I should wish to determine.' He squatted down\nin front of the wooden chair and examined the seat of it with the\ngreatest attention.\n\n'Thank you. That is quite settled,' said he, rising and putting his\nlens in his pocket. 'Hullo! Here is something interesting!'\n\nThe object which had caught his eye was a small dog lash hung on one\ncorner of the bed. The lash, however, was curled upon itself and tied\nso as to make a loop of whipcord.\n\n'What do you make of that, Watson?'\n\n'It’s a common enough lash. But I don’t know why it should be tied.'\n\n'That is not quite so common, is it? Ah, me! it’s a wicked world, and\nwhen a clever man turns his brains to crime it is the worst of all. I\nthink that I have seen enough now, Miss Stoner, and with your\npermission we shall walk out upon the lawn.'\n\nI had never seen my friend’s face so grim or his brow so dark as it was\nwhen we turned from the scene of this investigation. We had walked\nseveral times up and down the lawn, neither Miss Stoner nor myself\nliking to break in upon his thoughts before he roused himself from his\nreverie.\n\n'It is very essential, Miss Stoner,' said he, 'that you should\nabsolutely follow my advice in every respect.'\n\n'I shall most certainly do so.'\n\n'The matter is too serious for any hesitation. Your life may depend\nupon your compliance.'\n\n'I assure you that I am in your hands.'\n\n'In the first place, both my friend and I must spend the night in your\nroom.'\n\nBoth Miss Stoner and I gazed at him in astonishment.\n\n'Yes, it must be so. Let me explain. I believe that that is the village\ninn over there?'\n\n'Yes, that is the Crown.'\n\n'Very good. Your windows would be visible from there?'\n\n'Certainly.'\n\n'You must confine yourself to your room, on pretence of a headache,\nwhen your stepfather comes back. Then when you hear him retire for the\nnight, you must open the shutters of your window, undo the hasp, put\nyour lamp there as a signal to us, and then withdraw quietly with\neverything which you are likely to want into the room which you used to\noccupy. I have no doubt that, in spite of the repairs, you could manage\nthere for one night.'\n\n'Oh, yes, easily.'\n\n'The rest you will leave in our hands.'\n\n'But what will you do?'\n\n'We shall spend the night in your room, and we shall investigate the\ncause of this noise which has disturbed you.'\n\n'I believe, Mr. Holmes, that you have already made up your mind,' said\nMiss Stoner, laying her hand upon my companion’s sleeve.\n\n'Perhaps I have.'\n\n'Then, for pity’s sake, tell me what was the cause of my sister’s\ndeath.'\n\n'I should prefer to have clearer proofs before I speak.'\n\n'You can at least tell me whether my own thought is correct, and if she\ndied from some sudden fright.'\n\n'No, I do not think so. I think that there was probably some more\ntangible cause. And now, Miss Stoner, we must leave you for if Dr.\nRoylott returned and saw us our journey would be in vain. Good-bye, and\nbe brave, for if you will do what I have told you, you may rest assured\nthat we shall soon drive away the dangers that threaten you.'\n\nSherlock Holmes and I had no difficulty in engaging a bedroom and\nsitting-room at the Crown Inn. They were on the upper floor, and from\nour window we could command a view of the avenue gate, and of the\ninhabited wing of Stoke Moran Manor House. At dusk we saw Dr. Grimesby\nRoylott drive past, his huge form looming up beside the little figure\nof the lad who drove him. The boy had some slight difficulty in undoing\nthe heavy iron gates, and we heard the hoarse roar of the Doctor’s\nvoice and saw the fury with which he shook his clinched fists at him.\nThe trap drove on, and a few minutes later we saw a sudden light spring\nup among the trees as the lamp was lit in one of the sitting-rooms.\n\n'Do you know, Watson,' said Holmes as we sat together in the gathering\ndarkness, 'I have really some scruples as to taking you to-night. There\nis a distinct element of danger.'\n\n'Can I be of assistance?'\n\n'Your presence might be invaluable.'\n\n'Then I shall certainly come.'\n\n'It is very kind of you.'\n\n'You speak of danger. You have evidently seen more in these rooms than\nwas visible to me.'\n\n'No, but I fancy that I may have deduced a little more. I imagine that\nyou saw all that I did.'\n\n'I saw nothing remarkable save the bell-rope, and what purpose that\ncould answer I confess is more than I can imagine.'\n\n'You saw the ventilator, too?'\n\n'Yes, but I do not think that it is such a very unusual thing to have a\nsmall opening between two rooms. It was so small that a rat could\nhardly pass through.'\n\n'I knew that we should find a ventilator before ever we came to Stoke\nMoran.'\n\n'My dear Holmes!'\n\n'Oh, yes, I did. You remember in her statement she said that her sister\ncould smell Dr. Roylott’s cigar. Now, of course that suggested at once\nthat there must be a communication between the two rooms. It could only\nbe a small one, or it would have been remarked upon at the coroner’s\ninquiry. I deduced a ventilator.'\n\n'But what harm can there be in that?'\n\n'Well, there is at least a curious coincidence of dates. A ventilator\nis made, a cord is hung, and a lady who sleeps in the bed dies. Does\nnot that strike you?'\n\n'I cannot as yet see any connection.'\n\n'Did you observe anything very peculiar about that bed?'\n\n'No.'\n\n'It was clamped to the floor. Did you ever see a bed fastened like that\nbefore?'\n\n'I cannot say that I have.'\n\n'The lady could not move her bed. It must always be in the same\nrelative position to the ventilator and to the rope—or so we may call\nit, since it was clearly never meant for a bell-pull.'\n\n'Holmes,' I cried, 'I seem to see dimly what you are hinting at. We are\nonly just in time to prevent some subtle and horrible crime.'\n\n'Subtle enough and horrible enough. When a doctor does go wrong he is\nthe first of criminals. He has nerve and he has knowledge. Palmer and\nPritchard were among the heads of their profession. This man strikes\neven deeper, but I think, Watson, that we shall be able to strike\ndeeper still. But we shall have horrors enough before the night is\nover; for goodness’ sake let us have a quiet pipe and turn our minds\nfor a few hours to something more cheerful.'\n\nAbout nine o’clock the light among the trees was extinguished, and all\nwas dark in the direction of the Manor House. Two hours passed slowly\naway, and then, suddenly, just at the stroke of eleven, a single bright\nlight shone out right in front of us.\n\n'That is our signal,' said Holmes, springing to his feet; 'it comes\nfrom the middle window.'\n\nAs we passed out he exchanged a few words with the landlord, explaining\nthat we were going on a late visit to an acquaintance, and that it was\npossible that we might spend the night there. A moment later we were\nout on the dark road, a chill wind blowing in our faces, and one yellow\nlight twinkling in front of us through the gloom to guide us on our\nsombre errand.\n\nThere was little difficulty in entering the grounds, for unrepaired\nbreaches gaped in the old park wall. Making our way among the trees, we\nreached the lawn, crossed it, and were about to enter through the\nwindow when out from a clump of laurel bushes there darted what seemed\nto be a hideous and distorted child, who threw itself upon the grass\nwith writhing limbs and then ran swiftly across the lawn into the\ndarkness.\n\n'My God!' I whispered; 'did you see it?'\n\nHolmes was for the moment as startled as I. His hand closed like a vice\nupon my wrist in his agitation. Then he broke into a low laugh and put\nhis lips to my ear.\n\n'It is a nice household,' he murmured. 'That is the baboon.'\n\nI had forgotten the strange pets which the Doctor affected. There was a\ncheetah, too; perhaps we might find it upon our shoulders at any\nmoment. I confess that I felt easier in my mind when, after following\nHolmes’ example and slipping off my shoes, I found myself inside the\nbedroom. My companion noiselessly closed the shutters, moved the lamp\nonto the table, and cast his eyes round the room. All was as we had\nseen it in the daytime. Then creeping up to me and making a trumpet of\nhis hand, he whispered into my ear again so gently that it was all that\nI could do to distinguish the words:\n\n'The least sound would be fatal to our plans.'\n\nI nodded to show that I had heard.\n\n'We must sit without light. He would see it through the ventilator.'\n\nI nodded again.\n\n'Do not go asleep; your very life may depend upon it. Have your pistol\nready in case we should need it. I will sit on the side of the bed, and\nyou in that chair.'\n\nI took out my revolver and laid it on the corner of the table.\n\nHolmes had brought up a long thin cane, and this he placed upon the bed\nbeside him. By it he laid the box of matches and the stump of a candle.\nThen he turned down the lamp, and we were left in darkness.\n\nHow shall I ever forget that dreadful vigil? I could not hear a sound,\nnot even the drawing of a breath, and yet I knew that my companion sat\nopen-eyed, within a few feet of me, in the same state of nervous\ntension in which I was myself. The shutters cut off the least ray of\nlight, and we waited in absolute darkness.\n\nFrom outside came the occasional cry of a night-bird, and once at our\nvery window a long drawn catlike whine, which told us that the cheetah\nwas indeed at liberty. Far away we could hear the deep tones of the\nparish clock, which boomed out every quarter of an hour. How long they\nseemed, those quarters! Twelve struck, and one and two and three, and\nstill we sat waiting silently for whatever might befall.\n\nSuddenly there was the momentary gleam of a light up in the direction\nof the ventilator, which vanished immediately, but was succeeded by a\nstrong smell of burning oil and heated metal. Someone in the next room\nhad lit a dark-lantern. I heard a gentle sound of movement, and then\nall was silent once more, though the smell grew stronger. For half an\nhour I sat with straining ears. Then suddenly another sound became\naudible—a very gentle, soothing sound, like that of a small jet of\nsteam escaping continually from a kettle. The instant that we heard it,\nHolmes sprang from the bed, struck a match, and lashed furiously with\nhis cane at the bell-pull.\n\n'You see it, Watson?' he yelled. 'You see it?'\n\nBut I saw nothing. At the moment when Holmes struck the light I heard a\nlow, clear whistle, but the sudden glare flashing into my weary eyes\nmade it impossible for me to tell what it was at which my friend lashed\nso savagely. I could, however, see that his face was deadly pale and\nfilled with horror and loathing. He had ceased to strike and was gazing\nup at the ventilator when suddenly there broke from the silence of the\nnight the most horrible cry to which I have ever listened. It swelled\nup louder and louder, a hoarse yell of pain and fear and anger all\nmingled in the one dreadful shriek. They say that away down in the\nvillage, and even in the distant parsonage, that cry raised the\nsleepers from their beds. It struck cold to our hearts, and I stood\ngazing at Holmes, and he at me, until the last echoes of it had died\naway into the silence from which it rose.\n\n'What can it mean?' I gasped.\n\n'It means that it is all over,' Holmes answered. 'And perhaps, after\nall, it is for the best. Take your pistol, and we will enter Dr.\nRoylott’s room.'\n\nWith a grave face he lit the lamp and led the way down the corridor.\nTwice he struck at the chamber door without any reply from within. Then\nhe turned the handle and entered, I at his heels, with the cocked\npistol in my hand.\n\nIt was a singular sight which met our eyes. On the table stood a\ndark-lantern with the shutter half open, throwing a brilliant beam of\nlight upon the iron safe, the door of which was ajar. Beside this\ntable, on the wooden chair, sat Dr. Grimesby Roylott clad in a long\ngrey dressing-gown, his bare ankles protruding beneath, and his feet\nthrust into red heelless Turkish slippers. Across his lap lay the short\nstock with the long lash which we had noticed during the day. His chin\nwas cocked upward and his eyes were fixed in a dreadful, rigid stare at\nthe corner of the ceiling. Round his brow he had a peculiar yellow\nband, with brownish speckles, which seemed to be bound tightly round\nhis head. As we entered he made neither sound nor motion.\n\n'The band! the speckled band!' whispered Holmes.\n\nI took a step forward. In an instant his strange headgear began to\nmove, and there reared itself from among his hair the squat\ndiamond-shaped head and puffed neck of a loathsome serpent.\n\n'It is a swamp adder!' cried Holmes; 'the deadliest snake in India. He\nhas died within ten seconds of being bitten. Violence does, in truth,\nrecoil upon the violent, and the schemer falls into the pit which he\ndigs for another. Let us thrust this creature back into its den, and we\ncan then remove Miss Stoner to some place of shelter and let the county\npolice know what has happened.'\n\nAs he spoke he drew the dog-whip swiftly from the dead man’s lap, and\nthrowing the noose round the reptile’s neck he drew it from its horrid\nperch and, carrying it at arm’s length, threw it into the iron safe,\nwhich he closed upon it.\n\nSuch are the true facts of the death of Dr. Grimesby Roylott, of Stoke\nMoran. It is not necessary that I should prolong a narrative which has\nalready run to too great a length by telling how we broke the sad news\nto the terrified girl, how we conveyed her by the morning train to the\ncare of her good aunt at Harrow, of how the slow process of official\ninquiry came to the conclusion that the doctor met his fate while\nindiscreetly playing with a dangerous pet. The little which I had yet\nto learn of the case was told me by Sherlock Holmes as we travelled\nback next day.\n\n'I had,' said he, 'come to an entirely erroneous conclusion which\nshows, my dear Watson, how dangerous it always is to reason from\ninsufficient data. The presence of the gipsies, and the use of the word\n‘band,’ which was used by the poor girl, no doubt, to explain the\nappearance which she had caught a hurried glimpse of by the light of\nher match, were sufficient to put me upon an entirely wrong scent. I\ncan only claim the merit that I instantly reconsidered my position\nwhen, however, it became clear to me that whatever danger threatened an\noccupant of the room could not come either from the window or the door.\nMy attention was speedily drawn, as I have already remarked to you, to\nthis ventilator, and to the bell-rope which hung down to the bed. The\ndiscovery that this was a dummy, and that the bed was clamped to the\nfloor, instantly gave rise to the suspicion that the rope was there as\na bridge for something passing through the hole and coming to the bed.\nThe idea of a snake instantly occurred to me, and when I coupled it\nwith my knowledge that the doctor was furnished with a supply of\ncreatures from India, I felt that I was probably on the right track.\nThe idea of using a form of poison which could not possibly be\ndiscovered by any chemical test was just such a one as would occur to a\nclever and ruthless man who had had an Eastern training. The rapidity\nwith which such a poison would take effect would also, from his point\nof view, be an advantage. It would be a sharp-eyed coroner, indeed, who\ncould distinguish the two little dark punctures which would show where\nthe poison fangs had done their work. Then I thought of the whistle. Of\ncourse he must recall the snake before the morning light revealed it to\nthe victim. He had trained it, probably by the use of the milk which we\nsaw, to return to him when summoned. He would put it through this\nventilator at the hour that he thought best, with the certainty that it\nwould crawl down the rope and land on the bed. It might or might not\nbite the occupant, perhaps she might escape every night for a week, but\nsooner or later she must fall a victim.\n\n'I had come to these conclusions before ever I had entered his room. An\ninspection of his chair showed me that he had been in the habit of\nstanding on it, which of course would be necessary in order that he\nshould reach the ventilator. The sight of the safe, the saucer of milk,\nand the loop of whipcord were enough to finally dispel any doubts which\nmay have remained. The metallic clang heard by Miss Stoner was\nobviously caused by her stepfather hastily closing the door of his safe\nupon its terrible occupant. Having once made up my mind, you know the\nsteps which I took in order to put the matter to the proof. I heard the\ncreature hiss as I have no doubt that you did also, and I instantly lit\nthe light and attacked it.'\n\n'With the result of driving it through the ventilator.'\n\n'And also with the result of causing it to turn upon its master at the\nother side. Some of the blows of my cane came home and roused its\nsnakish temper, so that it flew upon the first person it saw. In this\nway I am no doubt indirectly responsible for Dr. Grimesby Roylott’s\ndeath, and I cannot say that it is likely to weigh very heavily upon my\nconscience.'\n"
