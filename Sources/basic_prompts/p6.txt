You are the investigator, looking for indicators 
which could deliver additional information about {clue}.
Details which are part of of the crime story {data_string} and  
associated with {clue} and {search_str} are to reveal with restrictions 
as visible below:
Any item, trail, witness, location or fact mentioned in the crime story but not in {clue} 
is an indicator.
If there are no indicators give a subtle hint like: 'Nothing special caught your eye',
or: 'The witness shrugs, he has no idea.'  
Reveal 1-3 indicators of all indicators associated with {clue} and give a subtle hint to search 
again if there are leftovers.
Answer in plain english. To this answer append the string '#RV#' followed by a list of the revealed 
indicators.
